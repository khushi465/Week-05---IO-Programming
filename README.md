## Overview

Week 5 introduced working with structured data formats (CSV and JSON), including reading, writing, and validation. We also explored Java annotations—from built-in to custom—and how to use reflection to inspect and manipulate Java programs at runtime.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Java I/O and exception handling  
- Completion of Week 4 topics (Generics, Collections, Streams, Exceptions)  

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder is organized by day, containing code samples, exercises, and notes. Use them to study, run, and tweak code examples to enhance your understanding of I/O and annotations in Java.

## Next Steps

In Week 6, we will begin exploring Java Backend Development using Spring Boot, covering the fundamentals of REST APIs, controllers, dependency injection, and building web applications.
